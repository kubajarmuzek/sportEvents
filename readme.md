# Tournament Management System

This project is a complete web and mobile application for managing sports tournaments. It was developed as part of an engineering thesis at the Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology and addresses the growing demand for digital tools supporting amateur and professional tournament organization.

## Project Overview

The system consists of:
- A **web application** for tournament organizers.
- A **mobile application** for participants.
- A **backend with a database** that handles business logic, scheduling, and data persistence.

## Purpose

The goal was to design and implement a modular and extensible IT system that allows:
- Creating and managing tournaments.
- Forming and managing teams.
- Signing up as a player or team.
- Generating schedules automatically for different formats.
- Recording match results and displaying standings.

## Features

### General
- Secure user registration and login.
- Role-based interface (organizer vs participant).
- Data validation and error handling.
- Real-time updates and result tracking.

### Supported Tournament Formats
- **Knockout (Cup)**
- **Round-robin (League)**
- **Double elimination**
- **Group stage with knockout phase**

### Organizer Features (Web & Mobile)
- Tournament creation and editing.
- Location selection with Mapbox API integration.
- Managing teams and participant requests.
- Starting tournaments and generating schedules.
- Inputting match results.
- Viewing match progress and standings.

### Participant Features (Mobile)
- Browse available and past tournaments.
- View tournament details.
- Join or create a team.
- Accept/reject team join requests.
- Track tournament results and standings.

## Technology Stack

### Web Application
- **React.js**
- **Axios** (API communication)
- **CSS Modules** (component-level styling)

### Mobile Application
- **React Native**
- **React Navigation** (screen transitions)
- **Axios** and **AsyncStorage**

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express.js**
- **Sequelize** ORM
- **MySQL** relational database
- REST API architecture

## Database Design

The database consists of key relational tables:
- `Users`
- `Participants`
- `Teams`
- `Tournaments`
- `Matches`
- `MatchSets`

Data integrity is ensured using foreign keys and ENUM constraints. Sensitive data such as passwords are stored using bcrypt hashing.

## Tournament Scheduling Algorithms

Each format includes an automatic schedule generation algorithm:

- **Knockout**: Bye rounds are added when necessary. Matches are shuffled to avoid pairing biases.
- **Round-robin**: Uses rotation method to schedule all matches.
- **Double elimination**: Manages upper/lower brackets and finals.
- **Group stage + knockout**: Teams are grouped randomly and paired in playoffs based on rankings.
